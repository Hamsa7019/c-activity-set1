#- used to get the variables from the studio library
# tellsthe compiler the lines which should be preprocessed
formal parameter - void add(int a,int b,int *sum)
actual parameter - output(a,b,c,largest);
what is main do?
main is where the program execution starts. it will call all the other functions in the program
In call by reference ,int input(int *a, int *b, int *c) -->  the input function takes three integer pointers as parameters, and inside the function, it directly modifies the values pointed to by these pointers without needing an additional integer variable. 
There is no difference between call by reference and pass by reference.
Call by reference --> when there is a change in formal parameter (int add(int *a,int *b)) then,the actual parameters (input(&a,&b)) also changes. all the operations performed on the value stored in the address of actual parameters.it is implemented by passing a value.
Call by value --> when there is change in formal parameters there is no change in actual parameters.
calling function--> actual parameter
called function--> formal parameter
change content of address variable is "called function".
actual variable is modified is "calling function".
syntax:-
int a; (normal variable)
int *b; (address/pointer variable)
*b=10; (change contents of address variable).
* --> pointer/ address, that can hold address of integer variable.
& --> it is copied to the variable during function call.
